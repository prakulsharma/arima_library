# ARIMA model
ARIMA stands for autoregressive integrated moving average.
This model takes in three parameteres - p, d, q
 - p - lag order (order of AR term)  – number of lagged observations used
 - d - degree of differencing (order of I term) – number of times observations are differenced to make it stationary
 - q - order of moving average (order of MA term) – moving window size or number of lagged forecast errors to be considered for training the model
